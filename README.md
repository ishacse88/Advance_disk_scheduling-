# Project Title: Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator

## Simple Meaning
This project is about creating a program that demonstrates how different **disk scheduling algorithms** work — such as **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**, **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**, **SCAN**, and **C-SCAN**.

## What It Will Do
- The user can input their own list of disk requests (numbers showing which tracks need to be accessed).  
- The simulator will show how each algorithm processes those requests.  
- It will also calculate how much time each algorithm takes to move the disk head (known as **seek time**).  
- The program will display performance results like **average seek time** and **system throughput** (how efficiently the system handles requests).

## In Short
I am building a simulator to **compare how different disk scheduling algorithms work and perform** in handling disk requests.
